## 8.2 Task 1 and Task 2
```{r}
getwd()
list.files()
```
I do not see a difference in file paths when I run this in the console vs the knit, which tells me that the working directory is set to the same location as my R notebook.

## 8.2 Task 3
```{r}
library(dslabs)
library(readr)
library(readxl)
```

## 8.2 Task 4 and Task 5
```{r}
data("mtcars")
data("movielens", package = "dslabs")
```

## 8.2 Task 6 and Task 7
```{r}
dplace_df <- read_csv("Values_Transport_dplace.csv")
car_prices_df <- read_excel("car_prices.xlsx")
```
